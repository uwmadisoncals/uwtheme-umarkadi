## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2017-05-05

### Deprecated

* A new hero content element has been added to the theme.

### Development process changes

Going forward, all new changes (except bug fixes/hotfixes) will be merged into dev instead of master. New version releases will occur when we merge the dev branch into master. This will mean dev is always the most bleeding edge version of the theme, while master is the latest stable release.
